hc: An Algebraic Calculator
Copyright 2010-2025, Brian Johnson

This is my attempt to write something that bridges the gap between a
simple calculator and a full-fledged computer algebra system.  "bc"
and "dc" are extant command-line calculators with various features,
hence "hc".  hc is written in Haskell, and one of its design goals is
to demonstrate that Haskell is practical as a language for medium-size
projects.

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
1. Install ghcup
2. make

FEATURES
* Exact integer and rational number arithmetic
* Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division of integers and variables
* Raising to integer powers
* Various simplifications are performed
* expand() multiplies out products/powers of sums
* Assignment to variables with :=
* Input with command line editing, history, and tab completion
