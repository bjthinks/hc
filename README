fc: the Functional Calculator
Copyright 2010, Brian Johnson

This is my attempt to write something that bridges the gap between a
simple calculator and a full-fledged computer algebra system.  "bc"
and "dc" are extant command-line calculators with various features,
hence "fc".  fc is written in Haskell, and one of its design goals is
to demonstrate that Haskell is practical as a language for medium-size
projects.
