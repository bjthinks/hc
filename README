fc: the Functional Calculator
Copyright 2010, Brian Johnson

This is my attempt to write something that bridges the gap between a
simple calculator and a full-fledged computer algebra system.  "bc"
and "dc" are extant command-line calculators with various features,
hence "fc".  fc is written in Haskell, and one of its design goals is
to demonstrate that Haskell is practical as a language for medium-size
projects.

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
1. Install the Haskell Platform with the readline extension
   (see README-readline for assistance)
2. make

FEATURES
* Addition, subtraction, and multiplication of integers and variables
* Various simplifications are performed
* Assignment to variables with :=
* Input via the GNU readline library with history and tab completion
