input is read in a loop
input loop uses readline
nonempty inputs are stored in the readline history
tab completion is not bound to filenames
arbitrary precision integer constants are an expression
tokenizer errors are shown
expression parser errors are shown
variable names are an expression
variables can be assigned to
unit testing framework
unit tests for tokenizer
unit tests for expression parser
unit tests for output displaying
variables values are stored in a map
variables in the currently evaluated expression are substituted with
	  their current values
sum of expressions is an expression
terms of a sum are sorted
sum of a sum is simplified to a single sum
zeroes are eliminated from sums
important test case:	input	output
			b:=3	b:=3
			a:=b	a:=b
			a	3
			b:=5	b:=5
			a	5
product of expressions is an expression
product of a product is simplified to a single product
ones are eliminated from products
terms of a product are sorted
sort order is lexicographic on variable names, and their powers
constants are last in sums, but first in products
outputs are numbered
output history accessed by % number (expression substitution)
tab completion is bound to variables

----------

unit tests for command parser
?? prompts are numbered
?? input history accessed by ! number (string or token substitution)
power of one expression by another is an expression
negation of an expression is an expression
quotients of expressions are expressions
quotient of quotient is simplified to a quotient of products
handle differences/negatives in sums
after sorting, like terms of a sum are combined via products
after sorting, like terms of a product are combined via exponentiation
expand function causes products of sums to be distributed
factor function causes sums of products to be factored
substitute function causes expression to be evaluated in a sub-context
	   with additional definitions
collect function causes a sum to be written as a polynomial in one of
	its indetermiates
